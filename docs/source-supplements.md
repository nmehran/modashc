# Source Supplements And Exact Helper Sources

## Status

V1 design and implementation contract. Source supplements are product inputs for
source-relevant values the compiler cannot infer from shell text alone. They are
not test hacks and they are not shell scripts.

This feature exists for common helper patterns such as:

```bash
source_safe() {
  if ! source "$@"; then
    return 1
  fi
}

source_safe ./PKGBUILD
source_safe "$MAKEPKG_LIBRARY/util/message.sh"
```

The compiler should support the exact call-site subset directly. Supplements
cover the remaining runtime-dynamic values only when the user supplies explicit
declarative data.

## Public Interface

CLI:

```sh
python modashc.py <entrypoint> <output> --mode executable --source-supplement source-supplement.json
```

API:

```python
compile_sources(entry_point, output_file, mode="executable", source_supplement="source-supplement.json")
get_sources(entrypoint, mode="executable", source_supplement="source-supplement.json")
```

The supplement format is JSON only. V1 uses `version: 1`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "variables": {
    "MAKEPKG_LIBRARY": "/usr/share/makepkg"
  },
  "functions": {
    "source_safe": [
      {
        "arguments": ["./PKGBUILD"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Relative supplement path values resolve from the entrypoint directory. Script
assignments override supplement variables. Supplement variables override the
process environment for source resolution.

## Exact Helper Sources

Quoted all-positionals source expressions are supported inside modeled local
function calls when they bind to exactly one source path argument:

- `source "$@"`
- `source "${@}"`
- `source "$*"`
- `source "${*}"`
- the same forms with `.`

The function call must already be source-aware and bounded: known local
definition, exact dispatch, exact arguments, no recursion, and modeled body
effects. The source path then passes through the normal resolver contract.

V1 intentionally rejects:

- zero-argument `source "$@"`
- multi-argument `source "$@"`, because direct `source file arg...` semantics
  are not modeled yet
- unquoted `$@` / `$*`
- dynamic function dispatch
- recursive source-bearing helpers
- branch-dependent helper signatures
- helper calls whose unresolved arguments are not supplied by a supplement

Source commands in helper guards such as `if ! source "$@"; then` are lowered at
the condition source site for the quoted all-positionals helper subset only.
Arbitrary source-bearing conditions, such as `if source ./dep.sh; then`, remain
unsupported until source-condition status semantics are modeled directly.
Executable output must still contain no live unresolved source command.

The V1 helper subset also models the common makepkg `source_safe` shopt restore
shape:

```bash
local shellopts=$(shopt -p extglob)
shopt -u extglob
if ! source "$@"; then
  ...
fi
eval "$shellopts"
```

The saved `shopt -p` payload must be exact and must not contain a source
command. Hidden or unresolved source-bearing `eval` payloads remain fail-closed.

## Supplement Validation

Supplements are declarative exact data:

- top-level keys are limited to `version`, `variables`, and `functions`
- `version` must be `1`
- variable and function names must be shell identifiers
- variable values and function arguments must be strings
- values must not contain shell expansion, command substitution, backticks, or
  newlines
- every supplied path value must exist after resolving relative to the
  entrypoint directory

Function entries define finite allowed source-path argument vectors for named
source helpers. They do not make arbitrary dynamic dispatch safe.

Retained source helpers that remain callable in generated executable output use
same-scope dispatch lowering for the supported V1 subset. That contract is
specified in [Retained Helper Dispatch](retained-helper-dispatch.md).

## Two-Pass Workflow

First pass:

- executable mode fails closed before writing output
- the diagnostic identifies the unresolved source-relevant value or helper
  argument
- the diagnostic includes `details.supplement_skeleton`
- the CLI prints the skeleton JSON to stderr

Second pass:

- the user supplies the JSON supplement
- the compiler validates the schema and paths before evaluation
- supplement variables seed the evaluator state
- supplement function signatures may supply unresolved helper call arguments
- executable mode proceeds only if every source site is exact

Example skeleton:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "variables": {
    "MAKEPKG_LIBRARY": "<path>"
  },
  "functions": {
    "source_safe": [
      {
        "arguments": ["<source-path>"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Context mode remains readable-first. It may preserve unresolved source text, but
it must not claim exact resolution unless the normal resolver or supplement
contract proves it.
